# Layer-Overlay

### What does this plugin do?
A python extension for Krita that adds a small toggleable overlay that shows the current layer you are viewing along with the layer above and below

### Why does this plugin exist?
Krita does already allows you to choose which parts of the window will become hidden when entering canvas only mode. However, those options don't discriminate, for example, which dockers will and will not be hidden.
